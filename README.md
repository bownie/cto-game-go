# CTO Game Go

A future thing.

# How I got here

https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules

and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cV1KESTJRc

Both helped.  But also:

  $ mkdir cto-game-go

  $ cd cto-game-go

  $ go mod init github.com/cto-game-go

Add the tcell dependency

  $ go get github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2

Then copy and paste an example from tcell and away you go.

Module and package management in go considered interesting.
